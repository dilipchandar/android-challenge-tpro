# Theoretical Questions

In order to proceed with the interviewing process T-Pro asked a couple of theoretical questions that are splitted by two levels.

## First Level

**1. Explain the main concept of lambda functions.**

 A:  Lambda functions are anonymous functions that don't have a name and can be treated as values. They can be passed as arguments to other functions. Through Lambda functions, we can define behavior at runtime also.

**2. What's the difference between `UInt16` and `Int32`?**

 A: UInt16 represents unsigned integers with values ranging from 0 to 65535 whereas Int32 represents signed integers with values ranging from  -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647

**4. Do you have any experience with functional programming languages?**

 A: Yes

## Second Level

**1. Do you have experience with C++ (JNI) code in Android projects? If yes describe what you have implemented.**

 A: Yes, implemented storing of sensitive information like API Keys using NDK or C++ (JNI) Code.
